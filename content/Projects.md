## Wedding Website
I utilized Python and the Flask framework to develop a website for my upcoming wedding. The RSVP functionality allows the guests to submit their response, allergies, and a note to the couple. I also created a feature that sends a custom text to my cellphone with guestsâ€™ response when they RSVP. Lastly, I configured a virtual private server (VPS) as a web server and mail server using Nginx/Postfix.
